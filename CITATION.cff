abstract: >-
  Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software automation, 
  but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context and lack of 
  explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a next-generation 
  architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and maintenance, designed 
  to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire codebases, histories, and 
  documentationâ€”all without fixed window limits. Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level 
  embedding memory engine, combining vector and graph-based indexing with continuous 
  code-aware retrieval. This enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions 
  of lines of code, supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, 
  and real-time self-healing actions. Chronos achieves 65.3% debugging success rate, 
  representing a 6-7x improvement over state-of-the-art models.
