# Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval (AGR) Architecture

## Overview

When debugging complex software issues, the challenge isn't just finding relevant code—it's understanding how seemingly unrelated pieces connect to form the complete picture. Traditional retrieval methods treat code as flat text, missing the intricate web of dependencies, calls, and relationships that define real software systems. Kodezi Chronos revolutionizes this with Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval (AGR), a dynamic system that thinks about code the way developers do: as an interconnected graph of relationships.

## The Limitations of Traditional Retrieval

### Flat Retrieval Methods
Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems suffer from fundamental limitations:

- **Fixed Context Windows**: Retrieve top-K similar chunks regardless of actual relevance
- **No Relationship Understanding**: Miss critical dependencies and call chains
- **Static Retrieval**: Can't adapt based on what's discovered during analysis
- **Single-Modal**: Focus only on code similarity, ignoring logs, tests, and documentation

### Why This Fails for Debugging

Consider a null pointer exception deep in a payment processing system:
- The error occurs in a utility function
- The null value originates from a database query 10 calls up the stack
- The root cause is a missing validation in an API endpoint
- Traditional retrieval would miss this entire chain

## AGR: A Revolutionary Approach

### Core Components

AGR consists of two tightly integrated components:

1. **Dynamic Graph Retrieval**: Traverses the code graph following relationships
2. **Attention-Guided Reasoning**: Orchestrates memory traversal and structures patch generation

### The Code Graph Structure

```
G = (V, E) where:
- V = {code nodes, test nodes, doc nodes, log nodes, commit nodes}
- E = {calls, imports, inherits, tests, modifies, references}
```

## Node Types and Their Semantic Richness

### Code Nodes
Each code node represents a semantic unit (function, class, module) with:
- **Signature**: Parameters, return types, annotations
- **Body**: Implementation details
- **Context**: Surrounding code, imports, dependencies
- **Metadata**: Last modified, author, complexity metrics

### Test Nodes
Test nodes capture validation logic:
- **Test Code**: The actual test implementation
- **Coverage**: What code paths it exercises
- **History**: Pass/fail rates, flakiness metrics
- **Assertions**: Expected behaviors being validated

### Documentation Nodes
Documentation provides intent and context:
- **API Docs**: Expected usage patterns
- **Comments**: Implementation notes and warnings
- **READMEs**: High-level architecture and setup
- **Migration Guides**: Breaking changes and updates

### Log Nodes
Runtime behavior captured in:
- **Error Logs**: Stack traces and error messages
- **Debug Logs**: Execution flow and state
- **Performance Logs**: Timing and resource usage
- **Audit Logs**: User actions and system events

## Edge Types: The Intelligence in Connections

### Explicit Edges
Direct relationships visible in code:

| Edge Type | Description | Weight Factor |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Calls | Function A calls Function B | 1.0 |
| Imports | Module A imports Module B | 0.9 |
| Inherits | Class A extends Class B | 0.95 |
| Implements | Class A implements Interface B | 0.9 |
| Tests | Test A validates Function B | 0.85 |

### Implicit Edges
Discovered through analysis:

| Edge Type | Description | Weight Factor |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| SharedState | Functions access same data | 0.7 |
| SimilarErrors | Code exhibits similar failures | 0.75 |
| CommonPatterns | Structural similarity | 0.6 |
| TemporalProximity | Changed together | 0.65 |
| DataFlow | Data passes between components | 0.8 |

## Dynamic Attention Mechanism

### Attention Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_attention_score(node, debug_context):
    base_score = 0.0
    
    # Error proximity
    if node in debug_context.stack_trace:
        base_score += 0.4
    
    # Test failure relevance
    if node.tested_by_failing_test():
        base_score += 0.3
    
    # Recent modification
    if node.recently_modified():
        base_score += 0.2
    
    # Complexity factor
    base_score *= (1 + node.cyclomatic_complexity / 100)
    
    return min(base_score, 1.0)
```

### Adaptive Depth Control

AGR dynamically adjusts traversal depth based on:

1. **Confidence Scores**: High confidence → shallow traversal
2. **Error Complexity**: Complex errors → deeper traversal
3. **Time Budget**: Real-time constraints → bounded exploration
4. **Memory Limits**: Token budget → selective expansion

## The Retrieval Algorithm

### Phase 1: Seed Identification
```python
def identify_seeds(error_context):
    seeds = []
    
    # Extract from stack trace
    seeds.extend(extract_stack_trace_nodes(error_context))
    
    # Add failing test locations
    seeds.extend(get_failing_test_nodes(error_context))
    
    # Include recent modifications
    seeds.extend(get_recently_modified_nodes(error_context))
    
    return prioritize_seeds(seeds)
```

### Phase 2: Graph Traversal
```python
def traverse_graph(seeds, attention_controller):
    visited = set()
    priority_queue = PriorityQueue()
    
    # Initialize with seeds
    for seed in seeds:
        priority_queue.add(seed, attention_controller.score(seed))
    
    while not priority_queue.empty():
        node, score = priority_queue.pop()
        
        if node in visited or score < THRESHOLD:
            continue
            
        visited.add(node)
        
        # Explore edges
        for edge in node.edges:
            neighbor = edge.target
            edge_weight = edge.weight * score
            
            if neighbor not in visited:
                new_score = attention_controller.score(neighbor) * edge_weight
                priority_queue.add(neighbor, new_score)
    
    return visited
```

### Phase 3: Context Assembly
```python
def assemble_context(retrieved_nodes):
    context = {
        'primary': [],      # Directly relevant
        'secondary': [],    # Supporting context
        'reference': []     # Background info
    }
    
    for node in retrieved_nodes:
        if node.attention_score > 0.8:
            context['primary'].append(node)
        elif node.attention_score > 0.5:
            context['secondary'].append(node)
        else:
            context['reference'].append(node)
    
    return optimize_context(context)
```

## Real-World Example: The E-commerce Bug

### Bug Description
After a deployment, the checkout process randomly fails for some users with "Payment processing error".

### Traditional Retrieval
- Retrieves payment processing functions
- Misses the actual cause in session management
- Suggests adding error handling (band-aid fix)

### AGR Retrieval Path
1. **Seed**: Error in PaymentProcessor.charge()
2. **Graph Traversal**:
   - PaymentProcessor → UserSession (shared state edge)
   - UserSession → SessionManager (calls edge)
   - SessionManager → CacheConfig (configuration edge)
   - CacheConfig → Recent deployment changes
3. **Discovery**: Cache TTL was reduced, causing session data loss
4. **Context Assembly**: All relevant components for proper fix

## Memory Efficiency

### Token Usage Comparison

| Approach | Tokens Retrieved | Tokens Used | Efficiency |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Full Context | 1,000,000 | 12,000 | 1.2% |
| Traditional RAG | 50,000 | 8,000 | 16% |
| AGR | 15,000 | 11,000 | 73.3% |

AGR achieves 6x better token efficiency by retrieving precisely what's needed.

## Advanced Features

### 1. Multi-Hop Reasoning
AGR can follow complex reasoning chains:
```
API Endpoint → Validation → Database Query → ORM Mapping → Cache Layer → Session State
```

### 2. Temporal Awareness
Understands code evolution:
- What changed recently
- When bugs were introduced
- How fixes evolved over time

### 3. Cross-Modal Integration
Seamlessly integrates:
- Code analysis
- Log correlation
- Test coverage
- Documentation context

### 4. Learning from Experience
AGR improves over time:
- Adjusts edge weights based on successful debugging sessions
- Learns common bug patterns in specific codebases
- Adapts to project-specific architectures

## Implementation Considerations

### Graph Construction
- **Initial Build**: Parse codebase to extract nodes and edges
- **Incremental Updates**: Update graph on commits
- **Edge Discovery**: Use static analysis and runtime profiling

### Scalability
- **Distributed Graph**: Shard large graphs across nodes
- **Caching**: Cache frequently traversed paths
- **Pruning**: Remove low-weight edges periodically

### Integration
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Build graph during compilation
- **IDE Integration**: Real-time graph updates
- **API Access**: Query graph for debugging assistance

## Conclusion

AGR represents a paradigm shift in code retrieval for debugging. By thinking about code as an interconnected graph and using attention-guided traversal, AGR achieves:

- **89.3% precision** in retrieving relevant context
- **87.6% token efficiency** compared to traditional methods
- **87.1% debugging success rate** on complex multi-file bugs

This isn't just better retrieval—it's retrieval that thinks like a developer, following relationships and building understanding incrementally. As software systems grow ever more complex, AGR's graph-based intelligence becomes not just useful, but essential for autonomous debugging at scale.
