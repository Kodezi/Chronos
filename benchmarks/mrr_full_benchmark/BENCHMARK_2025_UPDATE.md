# 2025 Benchmark Update Summary

## Overview

The 2025 evaluation of Kodezi Chronos demonstrates significant improvements and provides comprehensive comparisons against the latest frontier models.

## Key Results

### Overall Performance (N=5,000 scenarios, 12,500 total bugs)

| Model | Debug Success | 95% CI | Human Preference | Cohen's d |
|-------|---------------|--------|------------------|-----------|
| **Kodezi Chronos** | **67.3%** | ±2.1% | 89% | 3.87 |
| Claude-4-Opus | 14.2% | ±1.3% | - | - |
| GPT-4.1 | 13.8% | ±1.2% | - | - |
| Gemini-2.0-Pro | <15% | - | - | - |

### Performance Improvements from v1.0 to v2.0

- Debug Success: 65.3% → 67.3% (+2.0%)
- Retrieval Precision: 91% → 92% (+1.0%)
- Human Preference: New metric showing 89% preference
- Average Iterations: 2.2 → 7.8 (more thorough debugging)

### Architectural Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval (AGR)**
   - O(k log d) retrieval complexity proven
   - 92% precision at 85% recall
   - Multi-hop traversal up to 10M LOC

2. **Persistent Debug Memory (PDM)**
   - Trained on 15M+ debugging sessions
   - Cross-session learning capabilities
   - Pattern recognition across repositories

3. **7-Layer Architecture**
   - Specialized layers for debugging workflow
   - Iterative fix-test-refine loops
   - Automatic validation and refinement

### Benchmark Expansion

- Original: 5,000 scenarios
- Expanded: 12,500 total bugs with variations
- New categories: Hardware-dependent, Dynamic language issues

### Limitations Identified

| Issue Type | Success Rate | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| Hardware-dependent bugs | 23.4% | Requires physical environment |
| Dynamic language issues | 41.2% | Runtime type resolution challenges |

### Comparison with 2025 Models

**Code Generation Performance (for context):**
- Claude Opus 4: 72.5% on SWE-bench
- GPT-4.1: 54.6% on SWE-bench  
- Gemini 2.5 Pro: 63.8% on SWE-bench
- DeepSeek V3: Competitive at $5.6M training cost

**Debugging Performance Gap:**
Despite high code generation scores, all models achieve <15% on real-world debugging, highlighting the specialized nature of debugging tasks.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Debug-Specific Training**: 15M+ real debugging sessions vs generic code
2. **Execution Sandbox**: Validates fixes through actual execution
3. **Persistent Memory**: Learns from historical fixes
4. **Graph-Guided Retrieval**: Navigates complex dependencies

### Statistical Significance

- Cohen's d = 3.87 (very large effect size)
- p < 0.001 for all comparisons
- N = 50 human evaluators for preference study

### Efficiency Metrics

- Time Reduction: 40% faster debugging
- Iteration Improvement: 65% fewer failed attempts
- Cost Efficiency: 4-5x more cost-effective per successful fix

## Conclusion

The 2025 benchmarks confirm Chronos's position as the leading debugging-specific language model, with significant improvements over both previous versions and current frontier models.
