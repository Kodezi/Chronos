## Token Distribution Analysis

### The Output-Heavy Nature of Debugging

Unlike typical LLM tasks where input dwarfs output, debugging exhibits unique token distribution:

#### Input Token Distribution
| Component | Token Range | Average | Description |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Error Stack Traces | 200-500 | 350 | Stack trace and error messages |
| Relevant Source Code | 1,000-4,000 | 2,500 | Core code requiring analysis |
| Test Failures/Logs | 500-2,000 | 1,250 | Failed test output and logs |
| Prior Fix Attempts | 500-1,000 | 750 | Previous debugging attempts |
| **Total Input** | **2,200-7,500** | **4,850** | Complete debugging context |

#### Output Token Distribution
| Output Type | Avg Tokens | Token Share | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Bug Fix Code | 1,200 | 42.8% | Multi-file patches and fixes |
| Test Generation | 600 | 21.4% | New/updated test cases |
| Documentation + PR | 400 | 14.2% | Explanations and changelogs |
| Explanation/Reasoning | 400 | 14.2% | Root cause analysis |
| Fallbacks/Metadata | 300 | 10.7% | Alternative approaches |
| **Total Output** | **2,800** | **100%** | Complete debugging solution |

### Output Entropy Density (OED)

Debugging outputs exhibit high entropy, meaning each token carries unique information:

| Task Type | OED Score | Interpretation |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Code Completion | 18.3% | Highly predictable, boilerplate |
| Documentation | 22.7% | Somewhat templated |
| Test Generation | 31.4% | Moderate novelty |
| **Debugging** | **47.2%** | **High novelty, context-specific** |

## Context Window Efficiency

### Debugging Accuracy vs Input Context Size

| Context Size | Traditional LLMs | Chronos | Efficiency Gain |
|--------------|------------------|---------|-----------------|
| 10K tokens | 8.5% | 62.3% | 7.3x |
| 50K tokens | 10.2% | 66.8% | 6.5x |
| 100K tokens | 11.1% | 68.4% | 6.2x |
| 200K tokens | 11.8% | 69.1% | 5.9x |
| 500K tokens | 11.9% | 68.7% | 5.8x |
| 1M+ tokens | 12.0% | 67.9% | 5.7x |

**Key Insight**: Traditional LLMs plateau below 12% regardless of context size, while Chronos maintains 65-69% success with optimal performance around 200K tokens.
