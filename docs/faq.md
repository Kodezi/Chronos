# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### Q: What is Kodezi Chronos?
**A:** Kodezi Chronos is the first debugging-first language model specifically designed for autonomous bug detection, root cause analysis, and validated fix generation. It achieves a 67.3% debugging success rate, representing a 4-5x improvement over state-of-the-art models including Claude Opus 4 and GPT-4.1.

### Q: How can I access the Chronos model?
**A:** The Chronos model is proprietary and will be available:
- **Q4 2025**: Beta access for select enterprise partners via [chronos.so](https://chronos.so)
- **Q1 2026**: General availability through [Kodezi OS](https://kodezi.com/os)

### Q: What makes Chronos different from GitHub Copilot or other code assistants?
**A:** Key differences include:
- **Purpose-built for debugging** (not code completion)
- **Persistent memory** across sessions
- **Autonomous debugging loop** with validation
- **Repository-scale understanding** via AGR
- **Output-optimized architecture** for generating fixes

## Technical Questions

### Q: What is Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval (AGR)?
**A:** AGR is Chronos's novel retrieval mechanism that:
- Represents code as a graph with typed relationships
- Dynamically expands retrieval depth based on query complexity (O(k log d) complexity)
- Achieves unlimited effective context without massive context windows
- Provides 92% precision at 85% recall
- Achieves 87.1% debug success vs 23.4% for flat retrieval

### Q: How does Chronos handle large repositories (>1M LOC)?
**A:** Chronos maintains strong performance on large codebases through:
- Hierarchical embeddings (token → statement → function → module)
- Lazy loading with smart caching
- AGR's focused retrieval (only relevant context)
- Success rate of 59.7% even on 1M+ LOC repos (15.7x better than best baseline)

### Q: What programming languages does Chronos support?
**A:** The research focused on Python, JavaScript, and Java. Additional language support will be announced closer to the release date.

### Q: Can Chronos fix all types of bugs?
**A:** No. Chronos excels at:
- Logic errors (72.8% success)
- API issues (79.1% success)
- Concurrency bugs (58.3% success)

But has limitations with:
- Hardware-dependent bugs (23.4% success)
- Dynamic language issues (41.2% success)
- Distributed systems coordination (~30% success)

## Research Questions

### Q: How was the 67.3% success rate measured?
**A:** Success rate was measured on 5,000 real-world debugging scenarios (12,500 total bugs with variations) where:
- Each bug had a verified human fix
- Success meant the generated fix passed all tests
- No regressions were introduced
- Results were statistically validated (p < 0.001)
- Cohen's d = 3.87 effect size vs baselines

### Q: What is the Multi Random Retrieval (MRR) benchmark?
**A:** MRR is our novel benchmark that:
- Scatters debugging context across 10-50 files
- Spans 3-12 months of commit history
- Includes obfuscated dependencies
- Tests multi-modal retrieval (code, tests, logs, docs)
- Chronos achieves 89.2% precision vs 55-62% for competitors

### Q: How does Chronos compare to Claude 4 and GPT-4.1?
**A:** On debugging tasks specifically:
- **Chronos**: 67.3% success, 7.8 iterations, 89% human preference
- **Claude 4 Opus**: 14.2% success, 2.3 iterations
- **GPT-4.1**: 13.8% success, 1.8 iterations
- Despite Claude 4 achieving 72.5% on SWE-bench for code generation

### Q: What is Persistent Debug Memory (PDM)?
**A:** PDM is Chronos's cross-session learning system that:
- Stores patterns from 15M+ debugging sessions
- Maintains bug patterns, fixes, and codebase evolution
- Achieves 87% cache hit rate on recurring bugs
- Enables 6.8x faster resolution of similar issues

### Q: Why does Chronos perform more iterations (7.8) than other models?
**A:** Chronos's iterative approach:
- Validates each fix through actual test execution
- Refines based on test failures (not just syntax)
- Prevents regressions through comprehensive testing
- Results in 94.6% regression avoidance vs ~70% for single-shot approaches

### Q: How does AGR achieve O(k log d) complexity?
**A:** AGR's efficiency comes from:
- Adaptive k-hop expansion (stops when confident)
- Typed edge traversal (prioritizes relevant paths)
- Entropy-based early stopping
- Average 127 nodes retrieved vs 500+ for flat top-k
- Includes temporal dispersion (3-12 months)
- Features obfuscated dependencies
- Better reflects real-world debugging complexity

## Performance Questions

### Q: What are Chronos's performance characteristics?
**A:** Key performance metrics:
- **Retrieval**: 92% precision, 85% recall at k=10
- **Speed**: 47ms cached retrieval vs 3.2min cold start
- **Tokens**: 31.2K average retrieved (vs 89K+ for competitors)
- **Time**: 42.3 minutes average debug time

### Q: How does Chronos handle different repository sizes?
**A:** Performance by repository scale:
