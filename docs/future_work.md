@chronos.analyze
def process_payment(amount, user):
    # Chronos Warning: Potential null pointer
    # user.payment_method accessed without validation
    # 87% probability of NullPointerException
    
    method = user.payment_method  # <- Flagged
    return method.charge(amount)
```

## Medium-Term Research

### 2027: Human-AI Collaboration

**Interactive Debugging**
- Real-time pair debugging sessions
- Developer guidance integration
- Explanation of reasoning steps
- Confidence-based handoffs

**Collaborative Features**
```javascript
// Developer provides hint
chronos.debug({
  error: "PaymentFailedException",
  hint: "Check the new API rate limits",
  context: "Started after deploying v2.3"
});

// Chronos uses hint to focus search
// Result: 89% success (vs 65% without hint)
```

### Cross-Repository Federation

**Shared Learning** (with privacy preservation)
- Anonymous pattern sharing
- Industry bug databases
- Security vulnerability coordination
- Best practice propagation

**Example Integration**
```python
@requires(lambda x: x > 0)
@ensures(lambda result: result >= 0)
def sqrt(x: float) -> float:
    # Chronos ensures mathematical properties
    # are preserved in any fix
    pass
```
