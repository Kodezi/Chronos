## What is Kodezi Chronos?

Kodezi Chronos is a revolutionary AI system specifically designed for autonomous debugging. Unlike general-purpose code models that focus on code completion, Chronos is built from the ground up to:

- **Find and fix bugs** with 65.3% success rate
- **Identify root causes** with 78.4% accuracy
- **Work at repository scale** through intelligent retrieval
- **Learn continuously** from debugging sessions
- **Integrate seamlessly** with development workflows

## Key Achievements

| Metric | Chronos | Best Baseline | Improvement |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| Debug Success | 65.3% | 11.2% (Gemini) | 5.8x |
| Root Cause Accuracy | 78.4% | 15.8% (Gemini) | 5.0x |
| Average Fix Cycles | 2.2 | 5.1 (Gemini) | 2.3x faster |
| Cost per Success | $1.36 | $6.07 (Gemini) | 4.5x cheaper |

## Architecture Overview

Chronos implements a 7-layer architecture optimized for debugging:

1. **Multi-Source Input Layer** - Ingests code, logs, tests, docs
2. **Adaptive Retrieval Engine** - AGR for intelligent context
3. **Debug-Tuned LLM Core** - Specialized for debugging
4. **Orchestration Controller** - Manages iterative fixing
5. **Persistent Debug Memory** - Learns from experience
6. **Execution Sandbox** - Safe validation environment
7. **Explainability Layer** - Human-readable explanations
