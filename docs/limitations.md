# Known Limitations

While Kodezi Chronos represents a significant advancement in autonomous debugging, it's important to understand its current limitations. This transparency helps set appropriate expectations and guides future research directions.

## Performance Limitations

### 1. Hardware-Specific Bugs (23.4% success rate)

**Challenge**: Bugs requiring hardware-specific knowledge show significantly lower success rates.

**Examples**:
- GPU memory alignment issues
- Embedded system timing constraints
- Hardware interrupt handling
- Device driver bugs

**Why it struggles**:
- Limited hardware specification in training data
- Cannot execute hardware-specific tests
- Lacks real-time hardware state information

**Workaround**: Provide detailed hardware specifications and constraints in bug reports.

### 2. Dynamic Language Issues (41.2% success rate)

**Challenge**: Bugs in dynamically typed languages with runtime behavior.

**Examples**:
- Python duck typing errors
- JavaScript type coercion issues
- Ruby metaprogramming bugs
- Runtime-only type errors

**Why it struggles**:
- Type information not available statically
- Runtime behavior hard to predict
- Dynamic code generation challenges

**Workaround**: Use type hints, comprehensive tests, and runtime type checking.

### 3. Distributed Systems Bugs (30.0% success rate)

**Challenge**: Issues spanning multiple services and network boundaries.

**Examples**:
- Network partition failures
- Distributed consensus bugs
- Clock synchronization issues
- Cascading failures across services

**Why it struggles**:
- Cannot simulate full distributed environment
- Limited observability across services
- Complex timing and ordering issues

**Workaround**: Provide detailed logs from all services and network traces.

## Scale Limitations

### 1. Ultra-Large Monorepos (>10M LOC)

**Performance degradation**:
- Success rate drops to ~45% for 10M+ LOC repos
- Retrieval precision decreases
- Memory requirements increase significantly

**Causes**:
- Graph size becomes unwieldy
- Retrieval noise increases
- Context assembly takes longer

### 2. Highly Interconnected Systems

**Challenge**: Systems with extremely high coupling between components.

**Impact**:
- AGR may retrieve too much context
- Difficulty isolating bug impact
- Longer processing times

### 3. Legacy Code Without Documentation

**Success rate**: 38.9% on poorly documented legacy code

**Issues**:
- Cannot infer intent from code alone
- Cryptic variable names reduce understanding
- Missing context about design decisions

## Technical Limitations

### 1. Language Support

**Currently supported**:
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript  
- Java

**Limited support**:
- C/C++ (basic)
- Go (basic)
- Rust (experimental)

**Not supported**:
- Assembly languages
- Proprietary languages
- Domain-specific languages (DSLs)

### 2. Execution Environment Constraints

**Cannot handle**:
- Distributed system debugging across multiple machines
- Real-time system constraints
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing
- Production environment specificities

### 3. Cross-Language Debugging

**Challenge**: Bugs spanning multiple programming languages

**Success rate**: 41.2% for polyglot bugs

**Examples**:
- Python calling Rust via FFI
- JavaScript frontend with Java backend issues
- Mixed language build system problems

## Debugging Process Limitations

### 1. Maximum Iteration Limit

- Hard limit of 10 debugging iterations
- Some complex bugs may need more attempts
- No human-in-the-loop capability currently

### 2. Test Suite Dependency

- Requires comprehensive test suite for validation
- Cannot generate complex integration tests
- Limited effectiveness with flaky tests

### 3. Non-Deterministic Bugs

**Challenge**: Bugs that don't reproduce consistently

**Examples**:
- Race conditions with specific timing
- Environment-dependent issues
- Random failure patterns

**Success rate**: Lower for non-deterministic bugs

## Memory and Learning Limitations

### 1. Cold Start Problem

- New projects without history show reduced performance
- Takes ~100 debugging sessions to build effective memory
- Cannot transfer learning between unrelated projects

### 2. Memory Capacity

- Memory size grows with repository activity
- May need periodic pruning for very active repos
- Cannot remember every debugging session indefinitely

### 3. Pattern Overfitting

- May overapply patterns from frequent bug types
- Can miss novel bug categories
- Requires diverse debugging experiences

## Integration Limitations

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline Constraints

- Requires specific integration setup
- May timeout on very long test suites
- Limited support for custom build systems

### 2. IDE Integration

- Currently supports major IDEs only
- Some features may not work in all environments
- Requires stable internet connection

### 3. Security Restrictions

- Cannot debug in high-security environments
- Limited access to production systems
- Compliance restrictions in regulated industries

## Explanation Limitations

### 1. Complex Reasoning Transparency

- Some debugging decisions hard to explain
- Multi-step reasoning may be opaque
- Difficulty explaining learned patterns

### 2. Confidence Calibration

- May be overconfident in some fixes
- Uncertainty estimates still being improved
- Cannot always explain why confidence is low

## Mitigation Strategies

### For Best Results

1. **Provide comprehensive test suites**
2. **Include documentation in repository**
3. **Use descriptive variable names**
4. **Maintain clean code architecture**
5. **Include hardware/domain specifications**

### When to Use Human Debugging

Consider human intervention for:
- Safety-critical systems
- Hardware-specific issues
- Domain-specific correctness
- UI/UX problems
- Novel bug categories

## Future Improvements

These limitations guide our research priorities:

1. **Multi-modal capabilities** for UI debugging
2. **Expanded language support**
3. **Better hardware debugging**
4. **Enhanced domain adaptation**
5. **Improved explanation generation**

## Conclusion

Despite these limitations, Chronos still achieves 67.3% debugging success - a revolutionary improvement over existing approaches. Understanding these constraints helps set appropriate expectations and use Chronos most effectively.
