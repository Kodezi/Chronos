# Kodezi Chronos Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating Kodezi Chronos's debugging capabilities across various programming languages and bug categories. Each example includes before/after code samples and detailed analysis of Chronos's debugging process.

## Overview

Kodezi Chronos is a revolutionary debugging-first Large Language Model (LLM) that significantly outperforms traditional approaches in automated bug fixing. These examples showcase real-world scenarios where Chronos excels.

> **Note**: Kodezi Chronos is proprietary technology and will be available exclusively through Kodezi OS starting Q1 2026. Join the waitlist at [kodezi.com/os](https://kodezi.com/os).

## Example Categories

### 1. [Null Pointer Exceptions](./null_pointer/)
Demonstrates how Chronos handles null reference errors across different languages:
- Cross-module null propagation
- Defensive programming patterns
- Historical context analysis

### 2. [Race Conditions](./race_condition/)
Shows Chronos's approach to concurrent programming bugs:
- Thread safety violations
- Deadlock detection and resolution
- Synchronization issues

### 3. [Memory Leaks](./memory_leak/)
Illustrates memory management debugging:
- Resource lifecycle tracking
- Garbage collection issues
- Performance optimization

### 4. [API Migration](./api_migration/)
Examples of handling breaking changes:
- Deprecated method updates
- Library version conflicts
- Backward compatibility

### 5. [Performance Optimization](./performance_optimization/)
Demonstrates performance-related debugging:
- Algorithm inefficiencies
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies

## How to Use These Examples

Each example directory contains:

1. **README.md** - Detailed explanation of the bug scenario
2. **before.[ext]** - Code containing the bug
3. **after.[ext]** - Fixed code generated by Chronos
4. **analysis.md** - Step-by-step breakdown of Chronos's debugging process

### Understanding the Analysis

The analysis files show:
- **Bug Detection**: How Chronos identifies the issue
- **Context Retrieval**: What code and history Chronos examines
- **Fix Generation**: The reasoning behind the proposed solution
- **Validation**: How the fix is tested and verified

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval (AGR)
- Dynamic expansion of code context
- Efficient retrieval of only relevant code
- Cross-file dependency tracking

### Iterative Debugging Loop
- Multiple refinement attempts
- Test-driven validation
- Confidence scoring

### Language Support
Examples cover multiple languages:
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Java
- C++
- Go

## Performance Comparison

Typical success rates for bug categories (2025 benchmarks):

| Bug Type | Claude 4 Opus | Chronos | Improvement |
|----------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Syntax Errors | 85.6% | 94.2% | 1.1x |
| Logic Bugs | 12.1% | 72.8% | 6.0x |
| Concurrency | 3.2% | 58.3% | 18.2x |
| Memory Issues | 5.7% | 61.7% | 10.8x |
| API Misuse | 18.8% | 79.1% | 4.2x |
| Performance | 7.4% | 65.4% | 8.8x |

## Running the Examples

These examples show Chronos's expected behavior. The actual model is only available through Kodezi OS:

```python
# Conceptual API usage (available in Kodezi OS)
from kodezi import ChronosDebugger

debugger = ChronosDebugger()
result = debugger.debug(
    error_message="NullPointerException at line 45",
    file_path="src/UserService.java",
    repository_context="/path/to/repo"
)

print(result.explanation)
print(result.fixed_code)
print(result.confidence_score)
```
