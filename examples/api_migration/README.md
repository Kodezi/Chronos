# API Migration Example

This example demonstrates how Kodezi Chronos handles breaking API changes when upgrading a payment processing library from v2 to v3, with significant architectural changes.

## Bug Scenario

An e-commerce application needs to upgrade its payment processing library due to security requirements. The new version has completely restructured APIs, renamed methods, and changed async patterns.

## The Problem

- **Type**: Breaking API Changes
- **Complexity**: Complete architectural shift
- **Root Cause**: Major version upgrade with no backward compatibility
- **Impact**: Payment processing completely broken

## Files Involved

1. `PaymentService.py` - Main service using old API
2. `CheckoutController.py` - Controller with deprecated patterns
3. `PaymentConfig.py` - Configuration using old schema

## Chronos's Approach

1. **API Diff Analysis**: Compares old vs new API signatures
2. **Migration Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common migration paths
3. **Dependency Impact**: Traces all affected code paths
4. **Compatibility Layer**: Creates adapters where needed

## Results

- **Fix Success Rate**: 92%
- **Methods Migrated**: 23
- **Breaking Changes Fixed**: 15
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained for gradual migration

## Key Insights

This example showcases Chronos's ability to:
- Analyze API documentation and changes
- Map old patterns to new equivalents
- Handle async/await migrations
- Create compatibility wrappers
