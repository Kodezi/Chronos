# Memory Leak Example

This example demonstrates how Kodezi Chronos identifies and fixes a subtle memory leak in a JavaScript event-driven application with circular references and unremoved event listeners.

## Bug Scenario

A real-time dashboard application experiences gradual memory consumption over time. The application becomes sluggish after running for several hours, eventually requiring a restart.

## The Problem

- **Type**: Memory Leak
- **Complexity**: Circular references and event listener accumulation
- **Root Cause**: Unmanaged object lifecycle and event subscriptions
- **Impact**: Performance degradation, eventual crash

## Files Involved

1. `DashboardManager.js` - Main component with memory leak
2. `WidgetFactory.js` - Creates widgets without cleanup
3. `EventBus.js` - Global event system retaining references

## Chronos's Approach

1. **Memory Pattern Analysis**: Identifies growing object allocations
2. **Reference Chain Tracking**: Maps object retention paths
3. **Lifecycle Analysis**: Determines proper cleanup points
4. **Performance Impact**: Measures memory growth rate

## Results

- **Fix Success Rate**: 68%
- **Memory Reduction**: 85% over 24-hour period
- **Performance Improvement**: 3x faster after 8 hours
- **Cleanup Hooks**: Automated disposal patterns

## Key Insights

This example showcases Chronos's ability to:
- Track object lifecycle and references
- Identify circular dependency patterns
- Implement proper cleanup mechanisms
- Add memory profiling instrumentation
