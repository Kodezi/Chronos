# Race Condition Example

This example demonstrates how Kodezi Chronos identifies and fixes a subtle race condition in a multi-threaded inventory management system.

## Bug Scenario

A concurrent inventory update system experiences intermittent data corruption when multiple threads update the same product's stock level simultaneously. The bug only manifests under high load.

## The Problem

- **Type**: Race Condition / Data Corruption
- **Complexity**: Multi-threaded synchronization
- **Root Cause**: Unsafe concurrent access to shared state
- **Impact**: Inventory count discrepancies, overselling

## Files Involved

1. `InventoryService.py` - Main service with race condition
2. `ProductCache.py` - In-memory cache without thread safety
3. `OrderProcessor.py` - Concurrent order processing

## Chronos's Approach

1. **Concurrency Analysis**: Identifies shared state access patterns
2. **Thread Flow Tracking**: Maps potential race windows
3. **Lock Strategy**: Determines optimal synchronization approach
4. **Deadlock Prevention**: Ensures no circular dependencies

## Results

- **Fix Success Rate**: 71%
- **Performance Impact**: < 5% overhead
- **Deadlock Risk**: Eliminated
- **Test Coverage**: Concurrent stress tests added

## Key Insights

This example showcases Chronos's ability to:
- Analyze complex concurrent interactions
- Identify race windows in execution
- Apply appropriate synchronization primitives
- Maintain performance while ensuring safety
