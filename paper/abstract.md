# Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire codebases, histories, and documentation—all without fixed window limits.

Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code, supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and real-time self-healing actions.

Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain. Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts, simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models—demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based approaches.

By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

## Key Innovations

1. **Debugging-First Architecture**: Purpose-built as the first language model specifically designed for autonomous debugging rather than code completion
2. **Unlimited Context via Smart Retrieval**: Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval (AGR) enables repository-scale reasoning without token limits
3. **Persistent Debug Memory**: Cross-session learning from bug patterns and fixes
4. **Output-Optimized Design**: Recognizes debugging as inherently output-heavy, not input-heavy
5. **Multi Random Retrieval Benchmark**: Novel evaluation framework for debugging-oriented retrieval

## Impact

Kodezi Chronos represents a paradigm shift in automated software maintenance, achieving:
- 65.3% success rate on real-world debugging benchmarks (6-7x improvement over state-of-the-art)
- 40% reduction in debugging cycles
- 67% reduction in mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- ROI of 47:1 in first year for enterprise deployments
